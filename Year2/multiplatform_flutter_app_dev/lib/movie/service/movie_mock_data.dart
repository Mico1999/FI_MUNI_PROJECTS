      "Two families, Sebkovi and Krausovi, are celebrating christmas, but not everyone is in a good mood. Teenage kids think their fathers are totaly stupid, fathers are sure their children are nothing more than rebels, hating anything they say.",
  storyLine:
      "In a two-story villa in Prague-Košířy, two families share housing, whose fathers outwardly hate each other due to sharp political differences: while the war invalid Kraus (Jiří Kodet), who lives upstairs, does not hide his opinion that the communists have it figured out, then the major, who lives on the ground floor ČSLA Šebek (Miroslav Donutil) is an enthusiastic communist who believes in the progress of people's democratic countries compared to Western ones."
      "Both fathers try to play the role of the head of the family, but both are dominated by kind and understanding mothers (Emília Vášáryová, Simona Stašová). In both families, children are growing up who coincidentally are classmates at the gymnasium – Michal Šebek (Michael Beran) is in love with Jindřiška Krausová (Kristýna Nováková), but she actually likes the boyish Elien (Ondřej Brousek), whose parents are in the USA on business. And not even in any family do fathers understand their children: the new generation simply has different ideals than the previous generation."
      "The fate of Aunt Šebková, widowed teacher Eva and her son Péti, who find sympathy in the widower Kraus after the death of Mrs. Kraus, also plays a significant role in the story. On the other hand, the plot is catalyzed by Jindřiščin, Michal's and Elien's class professor Mašlán (Jaroslav Dušek), who actually hides heartless opportunism under the mask of an understanding pedagogue.",
